#SWE Project: Advisor Matcher

##Setup

###Vagrant

This is the easiest way if you have `VirtualBox` and `Vagrant` installed.

First checkout the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/agejku/se
    cd se/

Start the virtual machine with:

    vagrant up

This may take some time if you dont have the virtual machine (~300MB) donwloaded. After the initialization of the machine has ended you can access `Advisor Matcher` via typing `http://localhost:8080` into your browser.
